# Treasury & Wallets

The Treasury Manager is the central hub for all wallet operations in TrenchTools.

## Wallet Management

### Creating Wallets
- **Add Sub-Wallet**: Generate a new random keypair
- **Import**: Import an existing wallet via private key
- Choose type: Treasury, Sniper, or Burner

### Wallet Grid
Each wallet card shows:
- Name and type badge
- Public address (truncatable, copyable)
- SOL balance (auto-refreshes)
- Token holdings count

### Wallet Actions
- **Rename**: Change the wallet's display name
- **Change Type**: Switch between treasury/sniper/burner
- **Copy Address**: Copy public key to clipboard
- **Export**: Export private key (requires vault unlock)
- **Delete**: Permanently remove from vault

## Bulk Operations

### Bulk Fund
Send SOL from your treasury wallet to multiple sub-wallets at once.
1. Select target wallets
2. Enter SOL amount per wallet
3. Click Fund All
4. Each transfer is a separate on-chain transaction

::: tip Stealth Mode
Enable **Stealth Funding** in Settings to route each transfer through [ChangeNow](https://changenow.io). Each wallet gets funded from an unrelated on-chain source — invisible on Bubblemaps and Arkham. Adds ~2-10 min per wallet + ~0.55% fee. See [Stealth Funding](/features/stealth-funding) for details.

### Bulk Sweep
Collect all SOL from sub-wallets back to your treasury.
1. Select wallets to sweep
2. Click Sweep All
3. Each wallet transfers its balance minus a small fee reserve (5000 lamports)

### Sell All Tokens
Sell all token holdings across all selected wallets.
1. Select wallets
2. Click Sell All Tokens
3. For each wallet, scans token accounts
4. Attempts Jupiter sell first, falls back to PumpFun if needed
5. Records each trade in TX history

## Bot Wallets Section

At the bottom of the Treasury page, a collapsible **"Bot Wallets"** section shows wallets generated by Bot Groups.

- Grouped by bot name prefix (e.g., all "PumpBot-W*" together)
- Each wallet can be individually expanded to show:
  - **Sell Tokens**: Sell all tokens on this specific wallet
  - **Sweep SOL**: Transfer SOL back to treasury
  - **Copy**: Copy the wallet address

Bot wallets are filtered out of the main wallet grid to keep it clean.

## Security

- All private keys are encrypted in the browser vault
- Vault must be unlocked to perform any wallet operation
- Password is held in memory only while unlocked
- No keys are ever sent to any server
- Export creates an encrypted backup file
